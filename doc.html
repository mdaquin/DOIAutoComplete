  The tool <strong>DOIAutoComplete</strong> is a very simple script that tries to auto-fill a web from with information about a publication from the DOI of the publication. It is a bookmarklet, which means that it is a link that you can place in the bookmark bar of your browser, injecting some javacript code into the page you are currently looking at so that it can try to find what information to put where. 
  </p>
  
 <p> To install DOIAutoComplete is therefore very simple. Just Grab the big bold link below, a drop it on the bookmarkbar of your browser (it should normally between the address bar and the page. If not there, you should be able to make it appear in Chrome by hitting ctrl+shift+b).
